The architecture will primarily consist of the following:
  1. 8 Registers.
     Each of 16 bits. 
     R0 -> R7 . 
     R7 = P.C.
     R0 -> R6 in Register file
     PC separate .
  2. 2 Flags.
     Carry Flag
     Zero Flag
  3. Memory unit
  4. ALU unit -> (i) Adder
                 (ii) NAND gate
                 (iii) Subtractor for Branch on equality instruction
  5. Instruction Register
